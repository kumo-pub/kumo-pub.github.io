NuGet is highly project centric. This works well in managed languages with naturally stable ABIs, because base libraries can continue to evolve without breaking those higher up. However, in native languages where the ABI is much more fragile, the only robust strategy is to explicitly build each library against the exact dependencies that will be included in the final application. This is difficult to ensure in NuGet and leads to a highly disconnected and independently versioned ecosystem."]}),"\n"]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.h2,{id:"why-not-conan",children:"Why not Conan?"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"Conan.io is a publicly-federated, project-centric, cross-platform, C++ package manager written in python.

Conan relies on individuals publishing independent copies of each package. We believe this approach encourages a large number of packages that are all broken in different ways. We believe it is a waste of user's time to pick through the list of 20+ public packages for Boost 1.56 to determine the handful that will work for their particular situation. In contrast, we believe there should be a single, collaboratively maintained version which works for the vast majority of cases and allow users to hack freely on their private versions. We believe this will result in a set of high quality packages that are heavily tested with each other and form a fantastic base for any private modifications you need."]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(i.li,{children:["\n",(0,o.jsxs)(i.p,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"Per-dll vs Per-application"}),". When dependencies are independently versioned on a library level, it encourages every build environment to be a completely unique, unable to take advantage of or contribute to a solid, well tested ecosystem. In contrast, by versioning all libraries together as a platform (similar to a system package manager), we hope to congregate testing and effort on very common sets of library versions to maximize the quality and stability of the ecosystem. This also completely designs out the ability for a library to ask for versions that conflict with the application's choices (I want openssl Z and boost X but X only claims to work with openssl Y)."]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(i.li,{children:["\n",(0,o.jsxs)(i.p,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"Cross-platform vs single-platform"}),".
