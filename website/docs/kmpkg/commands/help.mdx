```Console
> kmpkg help versioning

Versioning allows you to deterministically control the precise revisions of dependencies used by
your project from within your manifest file.

The following versioning schemes are accepted.:
  version                A dot-separated sequence of numbers (1.2.3.4)
  version-date           A date (2021-01-01.5)
  version-semver         A Semantic Version 2.0 (2.1.0-rc2)
  version-string         An exact, incomparable version (Vista)

Each version additionally has a "port-version" which is a nonnegative integer. When rendered as
text, the port version (if nonzero) is added as a suffix to the primary version text separated by a
hash (#). Port-versions are sorted lexicographically after the primary version text, for example:
1.0.0 < 1.0.0#1 < 1.0.1 < 1.0.1#5 < 2.0.0

Manifests can place three kinds of constraints upon the versions used:
  builtin-baseline       The baseline references a commit within the kmpkg repository that
                         establishes a minimum version on every dependency in the graph. For
                         example, if no other constraints are specified (directly or transitively),
                         then the version will resolve to the baseline of the top level manifest.
                         Baselines of transitive dependencies are ignored.

  version>=              Within the "dependencies" field, each dependency can have a minimum
                         constraint listed. These minimum constraints will be used when transitively
                         depending upon this library. A minimum port-version can additionally be
                         specified with a '#' suffix.

  overrides              When used as the top-level manifest (such as when running `kmpkg install`
                         in the directory), overrides allow a manifest to short-circuit dependency
                         resolution and specify exactly the version to use. These can be used to
                         handle version conflicts, such as with `version-string` dependencies. They
                         will not be considered when transitively depended upon.

Kmpkg will select the minimum version found that matches all applicable constraints, including the
version from the baseline specified at top-level as well as any "version>=" constraints in the
graph.
The best approach to keep your libraries up to date is to update your baseline reference. This will
ensure all packages, including transitive ones, are updated. However if you need to update a package
independently, you can use a "version>=" constraint.
Additionally, package publishers can use "version>=" constraints to ensure that consumers are using
at least a certain minimum version of a given dependency. For example, if a library needs an API
added to boost-asio in 1.70, a "version>=" constraint will ensure transitive users use a sufficient
version even in the face of individual version overrides or cross-registry references.
Example manifest:
{
    "builtin-baseline": "a14a6bcb27287e3ec138dba1b948a0cdbc337a3a",
    "dependencies": [
        { "name": "zlib", "version>=": "1.2.11#8" },
        "rapidjson"
    ],
    "overrides": [
        { "name": "rapidjson", "version": "2020-09-14" }
    ]
}
