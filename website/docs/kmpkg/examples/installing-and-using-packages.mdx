# Installing and Using Packages Example: SQLite

> This old example uses Classic mode, but most developers will be happier with Manifest mode. See [Manifest mode: CMake Example](../consume/manifest-mode.mdx) for an example of converting to Manifest mode.

## Step 1: Install {#install}

First, we need to know what name [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) goes by in the ports tree. To do that, we'll run the `search` command and inspect the output:

```powershell
PS D:\src\kmpkg> .\kmpkg search sqlite
libodb-sqlite        2.4.0            Sqlite support for the ODB ORM library
sqlite3              3.32.1           SQLite is a software library that implements a se...

If your library is not listed, please open an issue at:
    https://gitee.com/kumo-pub/kmpkg/issues
```

Looking at the list, we can see that the port is named "sqlite3". You can also run the `search` command without arguments to see the full list of packages.

Installing is then as simple as using the `install` command.

```powershell
PS D:\src\kmpkg> .\kmpkg install sqlite3

Installing package sqlite3[core]:x86-windows...
Installing package sqlite3[core]:x86-windows... done
Elapsed time for package sqlite3:x86-windows: 12 s

Total elapsed time: 12.04 s

The package sqlite3:x86-windows provides CMake targets:

    find_package(unofficial-sqlite3 CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE unofficial::sqlite3::sqlite3))

```

We can check that sqlite3 was successfully installed for x86 Windows desktop by running the `list` command.

```powershell
PS D:\src\kmpkg> .\kmpkg list
sqlite3:x86-windows         3.32.1           SQLite is a software library that implements a se...
```

To install for other architectures and platforms such as Universal Windows Platform or x64 Desktop, you can suffix the package name with `:<target>`.

```powershell
PS D:\src\kmpkg> .\kmpkg install sqlite3:x86-uwp zlib:x64-windows
```

See `.\kmpkg help triplet` for all supported targets.

## Step 2: Use {#use}

### VS/MSBuild Project (User-wide integration) {#msbuild}

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Learn more about using kmpkg from MSBuild](../users/buildsystems/msbuild-integration.mdx)

The recommended and most productive way to use kmpkg is via user-wide integration, making the system available for all projects you build. The user-wide integration will prompt for administrator access the first time it is used on a given machine, but afterwards is no longer required and the integration is configured on a per-user basis.

```powershell
PS D:\src\kmpkg> .\kmpkg integrate install
Applied user-wide integration for this kmpkg root.

All C++ projects can now #include any installed libraries.
Linking will be handled automatically.
Installing new libraries will make them instantly available.
```

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to restart Visual Studio or perform a Build to update intellisense with the changes.

You can now simply use File -> New Project in Visual Studio and the library will be automatically available. For SQLite, you can try out their [C/C++ sample](https://sqlite.org/quickstart.html).

To remove the integration for your user, you can use `.\kmpkg integrate remove`.

### CMake (Toolchain File) {#cmake}

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Learn more about using kmpkg from CMake](../users/buildsystems/cmake-integration.mdx)

The best way to use installed libraries with cmake is via the toolchain file `scripts\buildsystems\kmpkg.cmake`. To use this file, you simply need to add it onto your CMake command line as:

  `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:\src\kmpkg\scripts\buildsystems\kmpkg.cmake`.

If you are using CMake through Open Folder with Visual Studio you can define `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` by adding a "variables" section to each of your `CMakeSettings.json` configurations:

```json
{
  "configurations": [{
    "name": "x86-Debug",
    "generator": "Visual Studio 15 2017",
    "configurationType" : "Debug",
    "buildRoot":  "${env.LOCALAPPDATA}\\CMakeBuild\\${workspaceHash}\\build\\${name}",
    "cmakeCommandArgs": "",
    "buildCommandArgs": "-m -v:minimal",
    "variables": [{
      "name": "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE",
      "value": "D:\\src\\kmpkg\\scripts\\buildsystems\\kmpkg.cmake"
    }]
  }]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> It might be necessary to delete the CMake cache folder of each modified configuration, to force a full regeneration. In the `CMake` menu, under `Cache (<configuration name>)` you'll find `Delete Cache Folders`.

Now let's make a simple CMake project with a main file.

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
project(test)

find_package(unofficial-sqlite3 CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_executable(main main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE unofficial::sqlite3::sqlite3)
```

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include <sqlite3.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("%s\n", sqlite3_libversion());
    return 0;
}
```

Then, we build our project in the normal CMake way:

```powershell
PS D:\src\cmake-test> mkdir build 
PS D:\src\cmake-test> cd build
PS D:\src\cmake-test\build> cmake .. "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:\src\kmpkg\scripts\buildsystems\kmpkg.cmake"
    // omitted CMake output here //
-- Build files have been written to: D:/src/cmake-test/build
PS D:\src\cmake-test\build> cmake --build .
    // omitted MSBuild output here //
Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)

Time Elapsed 00:00:02.38
PS D:\src\cmake-test\build> .\Debug\main.exe
3.15.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> The correct sqlite3.dll is automatically copied to the output folder when building for x86-windows. You will need to distribute this along with your application.

#### Handling libraries without native cmake support

Unlike other platforms, we do not automatically add the `include\` directory to your compilation line by default. If you're using a library that does not provide CMake integration, you will need to explicitly search for the files and add them yourself using [`find_path()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_path.html) and [`find_library()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_library.html).

```cmake
# To find and use catch
find_path(CATCH_INCLUDE_DIR catch.hpp)
target_include_directories(main PRIVATE ${CATCH_INCLUDE_DIR})

# To find and use azure-storage-cpp
find_path(WASTORAGE_INCLUDE_DIR was/blob.h)
find_library(WASTORAGE_LIBRARY wastorage)
target_include_directories(main PRIVATE ${WASTORAGE_INCLUDE_DIR})
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${WASTORAGE_LIBRARY})
```
